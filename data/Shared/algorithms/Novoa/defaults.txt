## Coefficients to compute Novoa turbidity and suspended particulate matter algorithms
## based on Nechad et al band specific calibration

## required wavelengths for Novoa SPM/TUR mixing
novoa_waves_req=665,865

## maximum difference for wavelengths
novoa_waves_off=40,40

## algorithm to use (currently nechad_centre and nechad_average)
novoa_algorithm=nechad_average
novoa_algorithm=nechad_centre

## output band switching results
novoa_output_switch=False

## algorithm switching bounds
## Novoa switches based on rhow in the red band
## green band for < rhow_switch_red[0] (currently not used)
## green+red between rhow_switch_red[0] and rhow_switch_red[1]
## red between rhow_switch_red[1] and rhow_switch_nir[0]
## red+nir between rhow_switch_nir[0] and rhow_switch_nir[1]
## nir above rhow_switch_nir[1]
##
## settings for Gironde
rhow_switch_red=0.007,0.016
rhow_switch_nir=0.08,0.12
## settings for Bourgneuf
#rhow_switch_red=0.007,0.016
#rhow_switch_nir=0.046,0.09
